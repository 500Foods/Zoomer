# Zoomer

This repository contains a Firefox plugin that is intended to do what many others do - automatically set the zoom level based on the URL. But in this case, we're interested in setting the URL for different pages within the same domain, which doesn't seem to be a feature in other zoom plugins.

## Key Dependencies

- [Tabulator](https://tabulator.info/) - Used to manage list of URLs for the plugin
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) - Used by Tabulator for date/time handling operations

## Additional Notes
While this project is currently under active development, feel free to give it a try and post any issues you encounter.  Or start a discussion if you would like to help steer the project in a particular direction.  Early days yet, so a good time to have your voice heard.
