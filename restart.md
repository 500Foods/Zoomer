What to Save for Easy Restart 📝
1. Current File State
Make sure you have the latest versions of these key files from our conversation:

background.js (complete version I provided)
options.js (complete version with sync storage)
manifest.json (with the addon ID for sync to work)
db-utils.js (with all the LRU and metrics functions)
url-utils.js (with the URL parsing and standardization)
2. Key Implementation Decisions
Storage Architecture:

Main data: IndexedDB (URLs, zoom levels) - stays local per device
Settings: browser.storage.sync (preferences sync across devices)
Component bitmask system (1=path, 2=query, 4=fragment)
Important Technical Notes:

Progressive specificity matching: host → host+path → host+path+query → etc.
LRU eviction: Default 10,000 URLs, purge 10% when limit reached
Debug logging strategy: All operational logs use debugLog(), only critical startup messages use console.log()
3. What Still Needs Building
Management UI (Starting with #30):

Table/list of all stored zoom settings
Search/filter functionality
CRUD operations (edit/delete individual entries)
Bulk operations including "purge domain" feature
Import/export functionality
4. Quick Test Plan
When you return, verify these still work:

Set custom zoom on a page → navigate away → return (should auto-apply)
Options page shows current storage stats
Debug mode toggle works
Component inclusion settings affect URL matching
5. Extension Status
Fully functional for primary use case ✅
HomeAssistant dashboard + calendar zoom levels working ✅
All core architecture complete ✅
